      body: |
        This change splits the existing triggered action into two, with much
        more specific filters that prevent the integration running unnecessarily
        on non-discourse threads.

        Needed to add jellyfish-plugin-product-os as a dev dependency to pull in
        the loop-balena-io contract and load it before running the translate
        integration tests so that jellyfish-core doesn't complain that the loop
        field is being set to a non-existent loop!
